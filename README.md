twisted-telnet-client
=====================

A simple python twisted telnet client example.

I was unable to find any examples of how to create and use a twisted telnet 
client on google! This is a small step on the way to fix that.

Do not that this is not a complete implementation of a telnet client. And 
therefore it does not take into consideration problems like authentication failures.
