twisted-telnet-client
=====================

A simple python twisted telnet client example.

I was unable to find any simple and easy examples on how to create and use 
the python framework twisted as a telnet client. As a result of reading many 
email list and forums I ended up with a short and hopefully 
easy to understand telnet client.

Do note that this is not a complete implementation of a telnet client and 
therefore it does not take into consideration problems like authentication failures.

I hope this can help others that need a simple telnet client in twisted.
